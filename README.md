# Viral-Advertising--Algo

This code solve a problem where the function viralAdvertising is supposed to calculate the number of likes after n days, but the logic is currently missing. The `ltrim` and `rtrim` functions are used to remove leading and trailing spaces from input strings, ensuring clean data for further processing. The main function reads the input, trims whitespace, converts it to an integer, and then calls the `viralAdvertising` function to compute and output the result to a file.
